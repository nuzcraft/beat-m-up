# Beat M Up Development Notes

This game will be created for [GDFG's Monthly Game Jam #27](https://itch.io/jam/gdfgs-monthly-game-jam-27)

## Overview

Jam Theme = Death by 1000 cuts; Modifier = 1 core mechanic

I feel like a sword swingin beat em up might be a neat and easy way to hit both the theme and modifier.

I have a memory of an old phone game I played (no idea the name) that had waves of enemies coming in from the left and right and the only controls were to tap on the left or right of the screen. The player would zoom to the closest enemy on that side and start a combo. Some enemies had shields or had specific attacks that needed to be dodged or interrupted. There was a score and the volume and types of enemies would accelerate as the game went on.

I think I can make something like that:

- aesthetically looking for sword or knife or some cutting thing
- simple controls (left right, maybe up down too)
- waves of enemies approach and must be defeated for high score
- some enemies require specific strategies to defeat
  - shields or armor must be broken
  - attacks must be avoided
  - attacks must be interrupted
  - projectiles must be dashed through
- 2d or 3d?
  - 2d would be easier, 3d would be cooler
  - start with 2d, see if mechanics can flow into 3d for stretch goal
